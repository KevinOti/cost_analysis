Scikit_learn is a machine library with plenty of tools that helps with learning patterns from data and even making predictions.



There are various machine learning challenges that can be solved using the library, they range from classification to clustering problems.



When performing a simple EDA (Exploratory Data analysis), there is very little that can be minted from data and that is when machine learning come on board to help with better understanding of the data and making predictions in the process.



Kaggle offers an opportunity for data enthusiast to engage in machine learning related competitions, recently worked on data for a competition that was posted 7months ago, this was a regression problem using RMLSE (Root mean_log_squared_error) for purposes of scoring the model, kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/media-campaign-cost-prediction



The amazing conclusion deduced from data regarding the important features are as below.



Top of the list - Factors that impact the investment put for to a acquire a customer.



1. Stores sales in millions -the higher the sales the higher the cost of acquisition**



2. Gross weight - weight of item mean the products of great value will feature more in the outlet**



3. Store_sqft - the bigger the store the higher the cost of acquisition**



4. Units_per_case - more units sold only more the cost will go up**



5. Total_children - Family set increase the cost to acquire**

 

Bottom of the list



Its important to engage the subject matter expert as some factors would seem to raise the cost of acquisition, personal opinion, these factors are attraction point meaning less will be used to acquire a customer
